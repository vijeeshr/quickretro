## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What else can I use QuickRetro for?</strong></summary>
While QuickRetro is designed primarily for running sprint retrospectives, it works really well for any situation that needs lightweight, private, and honest feedback.

Because it’s real-time, anonymous (when needed), and auto-cleans data (no long-term data storage), teams can use it for much more than retros:

**Common alternative uses include:**

- **Instant team feedback**  
  Gather quick thoughts after meetings, demos, or workshops - without long surveys or follow-ups.

- **Brainstorming sessions**  
  Let participants add ideas in parallel, reducing bias and encouraging quieter voices to contribute.

- **Team health checks**  
  Run short pulse checks to understand morale, blockers, or concerns in a safe, non-judgmental space.

- **Workshops & training sessions**  
  Collect feedback from attendees in real time to see what worked and what didn’t.

- **Temporary chat room**  
  Create an auto-deleting chat room without forcing account sign-ups.

QuickRetro’s focus on privacy, minimal setup, and automatic data deletion makes it especially useful when you want honest input without creating permanent records or tracking individuals.

<summary><strong>How does QuickRetro protect privacy?</strong></summary>

QuickRetro is designed to be privacy-first by default:

- **No accounts or sign-ups required** - participants can join and post instantly
- **Anonymous participation** - post without revealing identiy
- **Automatic data deletion** - all data removed after a configurable time
- **No data collection** - no tracking, profiling, or behavioral analytics
- **Self-hosting support** - keep all data fully under your control

This makes QuickRetro ideal for teams that want honest feedback without creating permanent records or collecting personal data.
